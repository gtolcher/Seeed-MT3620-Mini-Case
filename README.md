# Seeed-MT3620-Mini-Case

Simple Case for the Seeed MT3620 Mini Dev Board (Azure Sphere)

This is a pretty typical acrylic sandwich case, similar to what you'd expect for a mechanical keyboard. I put this together over a couple hours so that it would be able to safely live on my desk. As it was a quick project the measurements are serviceable but not exact, especially around the header pins. There are cutouts for the jumpers, battery and aforementioned pins.

Quick BoM:<br/>
   • 3mm acrylic for the case sides (sides can be 3D printed if desired)<br/>
   • 4x - M2 x 20mm socket head screws<br/>
   • 4x - M2 nuts<br/>
   • 8x - 3D printed 5mm spacers (file included)<br/>
   
I've uploaded the original Fusion 360 CAD files. While they are messy, I wanted to include them so people can freely modify / improve them. If there is enough interest in the project, I'll clean up the constraints, tighten up the measurements, and add acrylic snap fit feet.
